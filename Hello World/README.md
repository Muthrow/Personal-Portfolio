# Overview

This is a simple program to demonstrate the use of GitHub in creating and using online repositories.

My goal was to learn and show how someone could use VS Code integrated with Git and GitHub to easily collaborate online with others using source control software. Seeing as how everyone's first program is a 'hello world', it seemed fitting to use one for this demonstration.
