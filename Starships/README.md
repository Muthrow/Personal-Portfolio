# Starships

## Overview

This is a simple strategy game that can be played with 2 - 4 players. You take control of a small fleet of starships in an asteroid field with the goal of destroying the other fleets in the area. Carefully manuever your ships through the asteroids, using them as cover or even destroying them with your lasers. Use your resources and enviornment wisely and you might just come out on top!

Each faction has the same stats and abilities, all with 3 fighter class ships and one Capital ship. All ships can move and fire lasers, but they only do one each turn, becoming greyed out when their action is used. Each team only gets 3 actions on their turn. Crashing your ship into something damages both your ship and the object you hit. You can move your ships as far as you want, but your lasers have a limited range. Once you move your ship, you cannot change course, so plan carefully!

> Clever players may use a ship as a battering ram to take out a weaker enemy or a pesky asteroid

Asteroids are randomly scattered throughout the map at the begining of the game and can be destroyed during play by either being shot with a laser or hit by a ship. Each asteroid is a different size, with larger asteroids generally having more health than smaller ones.

The purpose of this project was to gain a better understanding of class design in python, as everything in this game and the _arcade_ library is represented by a class object.
