# Meal Tracking App - Java

## Overview

This is a Meal Tracking application to help those withing to track their eating habits. It uses the common system of tracking macros for its flexibility and simplicity.  The program works off single day increments, where the user inputs how many servings of a food item they've eaten. If the program has no data for the food item it asks the user to input the data, adapting to each specific user. The user can use the system to check what they have eaten on previous days, as well as information about a specific food item.

The goal is to make dieting and a healthier lifestyle more accessible by making tracking one's eating easier.

## Development Environment

I used VS Code and JDK to develop this program, using the Java programming language with the org.json library, along with the standard library.
